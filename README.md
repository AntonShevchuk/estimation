# Estimation

In this presentation, we will explore the various stages of the estimation process, from the initial express estimation
to the more detailed accurate estimation. We will also discuss the importance of the discovery phase in ensuring that
the estimation process is thorough and accurate.

We will begin by looking at the **express estimation**, which is the initial estimate made at the start of a project. 
This estimate is often made based on limited information and is used to provide a quick estimate of the project's scope
and potential timelines.

Next, we will explore the **rough estimation** stage, which involves a more detailed analysis of the project's 
requirements, potential risks, and resource needs. This stage provides a more accurate estimate of the project's 
timelines and costs.

Moving on to the **accurate estimation** stage, we will discuss how this stage involves a detailed analysis of the
project's requirements, as well as a thorough understanding of potential risks and resource needs. This stage provides
the most accurate estimate of the project's timelines and costs.

Finally, we will discuss the importance of the **discovery phase** in ensuring that the estimation process is thorough
and accurate. This phase involves a detailed analysis of the project's requirements and potential risks, as well as
a deep understanding of the project's goals and objectives.

Overall, this presentation will provide a comprehensive overview of the estimation process, including the various stages
involved and the importance of each stage in ensuring that the project is estimated accurately and effectively.
